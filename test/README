This directory contains a test suite. Run the suite with

$ ./runtests . (-v or -vv for more output)


Each subdir test_* must contain a file spec.py that is presumed to be the
specification file.

Tests can also be run individually from inside their directories, like so:

$ ../../aopyc -t spec.py .
$ python module.pyc


Each module to be tested must include a testspec somewhere in the module,
listing its correct output, like so:

### TESTSPEC ###
"""
Function name: compute
Function doc: Compute fun exponents
Function module: __main__
Function dict: {}
Received arguments: (4,) {}
Returning result: 256
256
"""

If executing the module after compilation produces the same output, the
test passes.


By convention, the injected statements are shown as comments:

# This shows an injected statement as a result of instrumentation.

## This shows the further programmatic injection contained in the aspect
## (generally a metaclass doing monkey patching)
